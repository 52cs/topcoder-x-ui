## Revoking and renewing a login token

#### Revoke

To revoke a token:

1.  Click your username in the upper-righthand corner of the page
2.  Select the `Settings` option
3.  You will see `Github` and `Gitlab` listed
4.  Click `Revoke` next to each and confirm the action on the confirmation popup
5.  The checkmark or warning icon and `Revoke` button next to `Gitlab` or `Github` will turn to a `Setup` button



#### Add a token

Once the token(s) are revoked, you can add them again by clicking the `Setup` button next to the Git provider.  This will walk you through the flow to reauthorize.
